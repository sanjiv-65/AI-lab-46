Assignment-1: Maze Solver using BFS and DFS<br><br>
Objective: Implement BFS and DFS to solve a maze. M|<br>
Problem Statement: Given a grid-based maze where 0 represents walls and 1 represents walkable paths, 
find the shortest path from a start cell to an end cell. Tasks:<br>
-Use BFS to find the shortest path.<br>
-Use DFS to explore all possible paths and report one valid path (not necessarily the shortest).<br>
-Compare the number of nodes explored by BFS and DFS. <br><hr>
Assignment-2: Route Finder Using Bi-Directional BFS/DFS<br><br>
 Objective: Use Bi-directional BFS/DFS to solve a navigation problem. <br>
 Problem Statement: Represent a city map as a graph where intersections are nodes and roads are edges. <br>Find the shortest path between two locations.<br>
 Tasks: 
-Implement Bi-directional BFS to minimize the number of nodes explored.<br>
-Compare the performance of Bi-directional BFS with standard BFS and DFS. <br>
-Visualize the search process (e.g., using a library like networkx in Python).
