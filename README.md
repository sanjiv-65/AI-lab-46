# Assignment-1:
Maze Solver using BFS and DFS
# Objective: 
Implement BFS and DFS to solve a maze. 
# Problem Statement:
Given a grid-based maze where 0 represents walls and 1 represents walkable paths, find the shortest path from a start cell to an end cell. Tasks:
-Use BFS to find the shortest path. ÔÅ¨ Use DFS to explore all possible paths and report one valid path (not necessarily the shortest).
-Compare the number of nodes explored by BFS and DFS. <hr>
# Assignment 2:
Route Finder Using Bi-Directional BFS/DFS
 # Objective: 
 Use Bi-directional BFS/DFS to solve a navigation problem. 
 # Problem Statement: 
 Represent a city map as a graph where intersections are nodes and roads are edges. 
 Find the shortest path between two locations. Tasks:
-Implement Bi-directional BFS to minimize the number of nodes explored.
-Compare the performance of Bi-directional BFS with standard BFS and DFS. 
-Visualize the search process (e.g., using a library like networkx in Python).
