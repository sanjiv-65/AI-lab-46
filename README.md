Maze Solver using BFS and DFS<br>
Objective: <br>
Implement BFS and DFS to solve a maze. M|<br>
Problem Statement:<br>
Given a grid-based maze where 0 represents walls and 1 represents walkable paths, find the shortest path from a start cell to an end cell. Tasks:<br>
-Use BFS to find the shortest path.<br>
-Use DFS to explore all possible paths and report one valid path (not necessarily the shortest).<br>
-Compare the number of nodes explored by BFS and DFS. <br><hr>
Assignment 2:<br>
Route Finder Using Bi-Directional BFS/DFS<br>
 Objective: <br>
 Use Bi-directional BFS/DFS to solve a navigation problem. <br>
 Problem Statement: <br>
 Represent a city map as a graph where intersections are nodes and roads are edges. Find the shortest path between two locations.
 Tasks: <br>
-Implement Bi-directional BFS to minimize the number of nodes explored.<br>
-Compare the performance of Bi-directional BFS with standard BFS and DFS. <br>
-Visualize the search process (e.g., using a library like networkx in Python).<br>
